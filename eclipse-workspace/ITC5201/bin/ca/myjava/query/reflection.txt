Explanation:
I have created total 6 classes as instructed.

For the first code:I did a connection and performed a select query with prepared statement and 
set the range through setInt and then simply printed the retrieved information.

For the second code:I did a connection and performed a select query with hard or static query by using simple statement and 
set the range in query and then simply printed the retrieved information.

For the Third code:I did a connection then took the input from user and performed a select query with prepared statement and 
set the range through setInt with user's input and then simply printed the retrieved information.

For the Fourth code:I did a connection then took the input from user and performed a insert query with prepared statement and 
set the data which are going to be inserted by using setString and setInt method and then simply use the switch case to take 
the user choice for retrieving inserted information or exit the code.

For the Fifth code:I did a connection and performed a select query then updated the result set 
by using a update resultset and then simply printed the retrieved and updated information.

For the Sixth code:I did a connection and performed a delete query with hard/static sql then simply used the if else 
condition to take the user choice for rollbacking information/recovering deleted data or exit the code.
